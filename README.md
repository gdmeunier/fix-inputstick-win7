# Fix InputStick for Windows 7
Fix the InputStick keyboard not working in Windows 7 in HID class (force Keyboard class).
Fixed using modified HIDInput & Keyboard drivers (actually just some INF file edits).

## What is this for?
It's made for the [InputStick.com USB receiver](http://inputstick.com/) which otherwise only works as a mouse on Windows 7 due to a bug in its HID keyboard class handling.

You likely don't need this if you don't own the physical InputStick device.\
However if you do have it & run Windows 7, then you will finally be happy to make it work with your older OS.
